At the age of 16, Marissa moved from the Netherlands to the USA, where she was surprised to find that it wasn't all skyscrapers, movie stars, and limousines like she had seen on television. Her first home was in a beautiful small town in Connecticut, and over the next few years of her life, she lived in several other cities up and down the East Coast. Through relocation, she has experienced a plethora of different cultures, enabling her to develop strong relationships with clients and friends. The Washington DC Metropolitan area is a great place to live and work, which is why Marissa chose to call it her home for almost 20 years. Prior to becoming a realtor, she assisted in the preparation of homes going on the market and consulted other agents. Her growing knowledge of the area quickly ignited a passion for real estate, jumpstarting her career with the Kevin White Team. Clients describe Marissa as friendly, detail-oriented, and dependable every step of the way. When she is not in the office, you’ll often find her spending time with her 3 children or directing neighborhood boot camps and indoor cycling classes. Marissa understands that finding your dream home is a big deal — which is why she surrounds herself with highly capable and competent team members, as well as the necessary resources to achieve a comfortable move.

I was shining shoes, shoveling show out of driveways, delivering newspapers, washing cars, bagging groceries. I KNOW the discipline of ‘hard work’, learning from failures, and the taste of EARNED success. I worked my way though life and achieved more victories than defeats. And there’s a power gained from NOT growing up the ‘easy way’. And I have it. My hustle, energy, and thoughtfulness makes my clients feel safe and become more successful.
